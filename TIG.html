<h1 class="title"> The Inheritance Games </h1>
<img class="rett" src="Image 1.jpg">
<p style="padding: 10px;">"The Inheritance Games," by Jennifer Lynn Barnes, is an extraordinary story full of dark family secrets, thrills, twists and turns, and deadly stakes. This is a fast-paced, page-turning novel. Every page you flip offers a new mystery while leaving another one unsolved. This remarkable book will have you falling out of your chair!<br><br>

    "The Inheritance Games" follows the life of Avery Grambs, a 17-year-old girl who stays in her car to avoid her half-sister Libby's abusive boyfriend, Drake. Avery only has one friend Maxine Liu, who continually listens to Avery complain about her life. On the other hand, Avery has a clear vision for her future: she will put her head down and work hard. Her life appears to be going well until a billionaire dies and leaves Avery virtually everything he owns. Avery must spend a year at the Hawthorne house, which is full of riddles, puzzles, and codes, to save her money! However, being in the Hawthorne mansion appears to be extremely risky to Avery, given that she is in a house full of individuals Tobias Hawthorne just disposed of. Including Grayson, Jameson, Alexander, and Nathaniel Hawthorne, the four Hawthorne grandsons. These four boys were brought up with the expectation of inheriting their grandfather's money. Grayson sees Avery as a stumbling block and is determined to overcome her. On the other hand, Jameson sees Avery as the ultimate puzzle left by his grandfather to solve and is motivated to do it. Avery still believes that everyone in the house is trying to kill her, but Oran, Avery's bodyguard, could disagree.<br><br>
    
    This young girl is left with a slew of unanswered questions, including why this old guy, whom she had never seen, chose her over his grandchildren or daughters to receive his inheritance. Avery Ricky Grambs must now figure out why he left her his fortune while avoiding assassination attempts and peril at every turn.<br><br>
    
    THIS WAS AN AMAZING BOOK! I personally enjoyed how this book kept me guessing with each turn of the page. This book was like a rollercoaster ride, with unexpected twists and turns. I especially enjoyed the author's inclusion of a family in a house full of hidden passages and mystery. It seems to emphasize the point. I also appreciate how the author described each Hawthorne grandson as having their secrets and motives for assassinating Avery Grambs. I didn't really like how Emily was addressed every two seconds in the book, though. For example, when Avery talks to someone and Emily appears out of nowhere. That was something I despised.<br><br>
    
    This is a book I would recommend to everyone aged 11 and up. Anyone who likes mystery or wants to be kept on their toes while reading this novel should read it. Even if you don't generally enjoy puzzles, this novel will undoubtedly change your opinion. I'd give this book a perfect score of 100/5 because it can't get any better. "The Inheritance Games" has a sequel, "The Hawthorne Legacy," equally as impressive. In August 2022, another book titled "The Final Gambit" will be released, so you should read "The Inheritances games" as soon as possible since "The Final Gambit" will sell out quickly.
